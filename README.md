# Cheese Calculator
This code is for calculating logistics for cheese. Once the user inputs the amount of kilograms of cheese produced; the program can calculate the number of containers to hold the amount of cheese inputted, the cost of producing the amount of cheese inputted, and lastly the profit of producing the amount of cheese inputted. This is done using given constant variables such as the container space, profit per container of cheese sold, and price of production per container of cheese, and using formulas to calculate these numbers.
